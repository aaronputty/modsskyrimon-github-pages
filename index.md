title: Aaron Putty's thoughts about Skyrim Modding
---
This site catalogs a bit of my experiences with Skyrim Modding and how I've gotten a lot of things to work on the steamdeck. You may eventually see a link to a wabbajack and some ideas available here. Or just thoughts about how things perform on the deck. It is heavily built on the discoveries of others, my own testing, and a lot of slow deployments.

Hopefully, it can be of help to a reader. Or at least a laugh here and there.

If a list is ever published, at least some reasoning for the mods within are there.
